# BmiCalc


Welcome to my BMI Calculator ! 

This uses the idea that our BMI is equal to our weight in kilograms, divided by our height squared. 


The specific guidelines regarding BMI is the following: 


# LB & CM or KG & CM
# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.
